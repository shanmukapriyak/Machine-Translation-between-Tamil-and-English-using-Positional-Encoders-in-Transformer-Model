# Machine-Translation-between-Tamil-and-English-using-Positional-Encoders-in-Transformer-Model
AI and NLP have led to the development of very advanced machine translation systems which can translate text from one language to another. 
Tamil is a language spoken by over 70 million people globally and there is a growing need for accurate and efficient translation systems that can translate Tamil text into English and vice versa. 
This project proposes a model for Tamil to English and English to Tamil translation using Transformer modelâ€™s positional encoder and  AI-NLP concepts. 
The model is trained using parallel corpus data and we observe the model's results and performance to arrive at a conclusion, there are many limitations and drawbacks to this. 
We elucidate the effectiveness of Transformer model for Tamil to English and English to Tamil translation, and the potential of AI for improving the machine.
